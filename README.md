## The main focus of this project is to use jQuery to generate a work day scheduler using the activities we learned this week.

The first step taken on on this project was to great the hourly rows on the html. I used bootstrap to loacte the format of the rows and once I managed to create 1 row duplicated for the remainder of the hours. My next step was to connect the html classes and elements with the css style. Lastly, I worked on the jQuery last. I input the date at the top of the page using moment.js to reflect the current day the page is viewed. The following step on the script.js was to retrieve the elements from the html that I want to add or make changes. After creating the variable I worked on the functions for the save button, local storage, and color for the past, present, and future. I was not able to complete the project. I had a hard time with jQuery.

The following image shows the completed web application after using JavaScript:
